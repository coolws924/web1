hello web

<h1>slow dancing in th dark</h1>
I don't want a friend (just me)
<p>I want my life in two (my life in two)</p>
Just one more night<br>
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (all night)
<p>I'm done fighting all night (waiting for you)
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You have made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?</p><p style="margin-top:45px:">
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
